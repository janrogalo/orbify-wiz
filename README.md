# Orbify Wizard 

```npm run dev``` to start

# What further improvements I could make?

1) For starters UI - I had big plans, but they were quickly verified by time constrains.
2) Imports - configure TS for better looking imports to avoid all these nested routes which are not pretty.
3) Configure testing environment + provide unit tests. I believe in TDD.
4) Reduce props drilling + use some kind of state management. But this seemed like an overkill for this task.
5) Take the extra half-hour and get a proper type / interface for the GeoJSON. 
6) Maybe write a custom hook to support form validation.
